USB Robotic Arm Interface for Raspberry Pi (in C++)

Created 17th March 2013 by Pete Dring

This project is designed to allow teachers and students to control a robotic arm using a raspberry pi.

The Robotic Arm in question is: http://www.maplin.co.uk/robotic-arm-kit-with-usb-pc-interface-266257. (cost Â£44.99 at time of writing)

Also available from http://www.owirobot.com/robotic-arm-edge-1/ with a manual controlled and the USB interface sold separately.

This project uses the research posted on http://notbrainsurgery.livejournal.com/38622.html
to create a control interface in C++ that can be used in other programs to control the robot arm with a raspberry pi.
